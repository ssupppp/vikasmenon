overall i want my previous experience to be just a footnote of my current life though it has been substantial



What am i doing currently?
I am currently working with Terrabyte - since Oct 2024.

Head of Games & Platform but in a startup that's pre-pmf this does not meany anything.

Currently we are making AI native games & experiences on Ripple AI; working on the cutting edge of interactive experiences * AI.


Why do I believe in Terrabyte?
This is a web article I wrote which is not yet published but has content as to why I am excited about the work I am doing. So pick the most useful references here that double down on that -- lose the other games/examples mentioned and make a complelling and clear reason to why it is a natural choice to work at a place like Terra which is working on the pushing the frontier for gamers across the globe


1. AI native games: Still Hour One
AI-Native Games: Still Hour One
The AI-native game space is still very early—hour one, if you will. But there's a big change coming, and the signs are there. Mobile gaming especially has been lagging behind, which is unusual because gaming typically leads innovation at the intersection of art, entertainment, tech, and consumer behavior.
We need to be prepared, because this is going to explode the gaming landscape.
What Makes a Game AI-Native?
There's confusion about what AI-native actually means. People often conflate it with using AI in the development pipeline—procedural generation, asset creation, or level design. Different people interpret these differently.
Playing with Inference offers a useful framework: AI-native games integrate machine learning or generative AI directly into the core game loop. These systems create content or behaviors that traditional development tools simply couldn't achieve at scale, fundamentally expanding what's possible for player agency, dynamic systems, and emergent behavior. It's about both the technology and how it transforms the player experience—not just where AI appears in production.
A simpler way to think about it comes from Joseph Kim:
If you remove AI from an AI-native game, the game collapses.
AI needs to be at the center—driving the core experience and moving the player from point A to point B. The player has to be interacting with AI front and center. Obviously, there are more layers where AI can contribute, but this is the foundation—the starting point everything else builds on.
The player must feel the AI. They don't need to know whether AI is generating the response, simulating logic, or mimicking a player—but they should feel the presence of intelligence in every interaction.
The PC Pioneers
This is best explained with examples. On PC and web, several games have already shown what truly AI-native experiences look like.
AI2U: With You Til The End — the player interacts with a Yandere girl while trying to escape. Every behavior—whether she leaves the room, stays, or offers hints—is driven by AI. Parameters are controlled by AI logic. Remove AI, and the entire experience collapses.
Suck Up! — another strong example. You play as a vampire negotiating entry into homes or talking to police officers. The entire progression depends on AI-driven dialogue and dynamic social reasoning.
These examples show what's possible when AI drives the core experience. Right now, most of these implementations are text-driven and stat-based, but that will evolve quickly. Other interaction models—voice, gesture, emotion, expression—will soon define the next generation of AI-native games.
The Companion App Wave
On mobile, it's still early days, but the companion app space is seeing interesting movement.
Ani and Valentine from Grok have set new standards for AI-driven companions. Their responses are rich and non-deterministic—but more importantly, AI controls emotion, movement, expression, and environmental cues in real time. AI spawns characters, manages animation systems, and generates emotional responses—creating a full-spectrum emotional experience led entirely by intelligence.
Other apps like Replika, Character.AI, and Other Half have proven the demand for emotional, conversational AI. And now, new 3D-based companions are emerging, pushing the space further. There's real momentum here.
Mobile Gaming: The Add-On Problem
Gaming specifically is just catching up. In most cases, AI shows up as an add-on feature. You complete a level built by code and logic, and then hand over the experience to AI for a chat or report card. The core loop remains traditional; the AI layer sits on top.
There are still great experiments. Pengu and Chonk are clever examples—co-parenting pet games built around nurturing and social play. The AI touches appear when the pet writes letters or reflects on how it felt being raised. That's creative and meaningful work.
Match-3 and puzzle games are also starting to experiment—AI handling difficulty tuning, asset generation, or level variety. But here's the key distinction:
If you remove AI, the game still works. The mechanic might change—but it doesn't collapse.
These are promising first steps, but not the final destination. The next wave needs to move beyond enhancement into AI as the core interaction layer—where the gameplay itself wouldn't exist without AI.
Gaming Catches Up
The entire world has been exploring AI for the past few years. Every industry is figuring out what it means for them. But gaming has been unusually quiet. That's strange—because gaming has always been the bridge between new technology and human experience. We're the ones who make tech emotional, expressive, and playable.
That's about to change—and fast.
Why We're Excited About Building AI-Native
At Ripple AI, we're building at the edge of what's possible. It feels like hour one again. Things are only going to accelerate from here.
We already see hints of what's coming. Some early tests show genuine emotional connection and engagement. Others remind us how much work remains. That's the exciting part—it's unexplored territory.
The opportunity is massive. LLMs are becoming more capable. Hardware is improving. Infrastructure is ready. Everything is aligning.
The questions we're asking:

How do we make AI interactions feel natural and emotionally real?
How do we design loops that collapse without AI at the center?
How do we build experiences that couldn't exist before now?

We don't have all the answers yet. We're experimenting, iterating, learning. But the path forward is clear—games that live and breathe through intelligence.
Because that's where this is headed. Not AI-assisted. Not AI-enhanced.
AI-native.
And we're just getting started.

Ripple AI live on iOS and GP

https://apps.apple.com/in/app/ripple-ai-chat-play-drama/id6751642933

Several games and experiences in pipeline. Will be launched soon.

Already live -->
1. Redflag.exe -- You wake up and find yourself locked in a room with a perfect girlfriend. Or is she? Navigate through conversations and find a way to escape, before you become another of her victims. 
2. Snackula --> You are a vampire out looking for a midnight snack. Knock on doors of a friendly neighbor hood and convince strangers to let you inside. 

In Redflag.exe -- the AI girlfiend is the AI element
In Snackula -- the neihbors who open the door are AI elements

I guess what is relevant from a portfolio standpoint is 
1. mobile + AI native games --> first couple of attempts
2. end to end from inception to launch


----------------

The jump to start up and join Terrabyte
1. It was not an easy jump
2. Corporate life is good
3. But it's a slow boat China
4. Themes around : Creating something new, pushing the boundaries, calling something my own, learning new things, taking a big swing at life
5. What is life if you are not excited by the work that is done

Important to -- never diss Zynga or corporate life; talented people, i learnt a lot. I just wanted a different challenge
