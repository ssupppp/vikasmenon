                            <p class="article-preview">The AI-native game space is still very early. Mobile gaming especially has been lagging behind, which is unusual because gaming typically leads innovation at the intersection of art, entertainment, tech, and consumer behavior.</p>

                                <p>At Ripple AI, we're building games where if you remove the AI, the experience collapses. Games where players feel intelligence in every interaction.</p>
                                <p>What makes a game AI-native? A simple way to think about it: if you remove AI from an AI-native game, the game collapses. AI needs to be at the center—driving the core experience and moving the player from point A to point B.</p>
                                <p>The player must feel the AI. They don't need to know whether AI is generating the response, simulating logic, or mimicking a player—but they should feel the presence of intelligence in every interaction.</p>
                                <p>We're experimenting, iterating, learning—and just getting started. The questions we're asking: How do we make AI interactions feel natural and emotionally real? How do we design loops that collapse without AI at the center? How do we build experiences that couldn't exist before now?</p>
                                <p>We don't have all the answers yet. But the path forward is clear—games that live and breathe through intelligence. Not AI-assisted. Not AI-enhanced. AI-native.</p>

                            <p class="article-preview">For over a decade, I've been playing Fantasy Premier League. And for over a decade, I've been consistently terrible at it. I decided to build something to help analyze it better.</p>
                            <button class="read-more-btn" data-article="3">Read more</button>
                            <div class="article-full-content" id="article-3" style="display: none;">
                                <p>For over a decade, I've been playing Fantasy Premier League (FPL). And for over a decade, I've been consistently terrible at it. Don't get me wrong – I love the game. But after years of mid-table finishes and failed triple-captain choices, I decided to do something different. If I couldn't beat the game with gut instinct, maybe I could build something to help analyze it better.</p>
                                <p>One small catch: I hadn't coded in years.</p>
                                <p><strong>The Spark</strong></p>
                                <p>It started with someone mentioning these new AI assistants that could help with coding. As someone whose last significant coding experience was debugging on Lotus Notes, this caught my attention. Could AI help bridge my knowledge gap?</p>
                                <p>Enter Claude and Replit. Both were new to me, but they seemed user-friendly enough for a rusty developer to experiment with.</p>
                                <p><strong>First Attempt: The Screenshot Dream</strong></p>
                                <p>My first approach was simple: build an app that could analyze FPL team screenshots. Why screenshots? Because that's how most of us share our teams in WhatsApp groups. It's quick, it's easy, and it shows everything at a glance.</p>
                                <p>I dove into Optical Character Recognition (OCR) – the technology that converts images to text. Sounds straightforward, right? Well, as it turns out, teaching a computer to read player names from screenshots is about as reliable as my captain picks this season. Sometimes it would read "Mohamed Salah" as "No Bad Sala", and other times it would think the pitch grid lines were player names.</p>
                                <p><strong>The API Pivot</strong></p>
                                <p>After a week of wrestling with OCR, I remembered something: FPL has an API. I'd known about it for a while but had initially avoided it. Why? Because I wanted this tool to be accessible to everyone, not just the tech-savvy who could find their team ID.</p>
                                <p>But sometimes the easier path isn't the better one. Once I started working with the API, things clicked. My first successful API call felt like scoring in the 90th minute!</p>
                                <p><strong>Building the Brain</strong></p>
                                <p>With reliable data flowing in, I could focus on what mattered: the rating algorithm. How do you quantify if a team is good? I developed a system that looks at: Goalkeepers and Defenders (70% based on clean sheets, 30% on attacking returns), Midfielders (80% attacking returns, 20% clean sheets), and Forwards (Pure attacking returns).</p>
                                <p>I also incorporated Fixture Difficulty Rating (FDR) because let's face it – playing against Manchester City away isn't the same as hosting a newly promoted team.</p>
                                <p><strong>The Final Product</strong></p>
                                <p>The result? A web application that rates your FPL team on a scale of 1-100, analyzes player performance based on position, and considers upcoming fixtures in the rating.</p>

                                <p>I'm still not great at FPL, but at least now I have data to explain why.</p>

                            <p class="article-preview">Jeff Bezos provided a framework that I found interesting. I have used it a few times when presented with a complex question with no easy answers. He was a master of inverting.</p>

                                <p>Jeff Bezos provided a framework that I found interesting. I have used it a few times when presented with a complex question with no easy answers. He was a master of inverting.</p>
                                <p><em>"I very frequently get the question: 'What's going to change in the next 10 years?' And that is a very interesting question; it's a very common one. I almost never get the question: 'What's not going to change in the next 10 years?' And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two -- because you can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time. ... [I]n our retail business, we know that customers want low prices, and I know that's going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection."</em></p>
                                <p>In game development, the pace of innovation is extremely fast. Technologies change, relationships with partners change, the industry evolves and before you know it the pipeline that caters to deliver great games needs to play catch up.</p>
                                <p>If everything else is changing, a good question to ask yourself as a game producer is - "What will not change in the next decade?"</p>
                                <p>It is impossible to imagine a scenario where great games and software updates will not be necessary to be delivered with great urgency and high predictability. Time to market will make or break game studios.</p>
                                <p>Your game development strategy needs to be focused on not speed, but instead velocity. Your game development strategy needs to be a living organism - constantly iterating and evolving, asking the right questions every turn. If you have a new game idea, ask yourself: How fast you can validate that idea? How fast can you take that idea to market?</p>
                                <p>If you are not happy with the answer - time to tinker with your process. Your entire organization needs to be set up that way. You need to be ok to take hard calls. You should be ok to prioritize ruthlessly. You must be able to provide focus for your team. Don't add, but instead subtract. Remove bets that don't matter.</p>
                                <p>Focusing on velocity ensures that the team is moving in the right direction. Focusing on volume ensures you have more frequent updates and more releases, but overall you will find you are shipping less meaningful work.</p>

                            <h2 class="article-title">MY VALUES</h2>
                            <p class="article-preview">What do I stand for? Through introspection and reviewing professional and personal relationships over the last couple of decades, I've identified three core values: Integrity, Respect, and Resilience.</p>
                            <button class="read-more-btn" data-article="6">Read more</button>
                            <div class="article-full-content" id="article-6" style="display: none;">
                                <p>It seems quite surreal that here I am writing a post about values while through my professional career, I have had a hard time believing that any organization takes its values seriously. Like they say… <strong>When the Student is Ready, the Teacher Will Appear</strong></p>
                                <p>So what are my core values? What is it that I stand for?</p>
                                <p><strong>Integrity</strong></p>
                                <p>A long, long time ago I had an interesting conversation with one of my professors. It was midnight. There was a surprise raid in our hostel block. The warden found a bottle of Old Monk in my cupboard. This was bad news.</p>
                                <p>I was called on to provide an explanation. The professor spoke - "Vikas, I know this bottle is not yours. Someone kept it there. I don't believe you would do this and break the rules. Tell me whose bottle this is?". I was taken aback but my reply was quite quick- "This bottle is mine."</p>
                                <p>Before leaving the room, my professor thanked me for my honesty and said that he appreciates how I owned up in spite of him cooking up a random story.</p>
                                <p>I don't cook up random stories. I am honest and show a consistent adherence to moral and ethical values, however uncomfortable it might be for me.</p>
                                <p><strong>Respect</strong></p>
                                <p>I now tend to take a long term view of relationships. I keep reminding myself of this quote from the Pale Blue Dot: "It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another."</p>
                                <p>I understand the world is huge and diverse. There are a lot of differences in beliefs, cultures and ways of thinking but one thing that remains consistent is how you make people feel. I like to treat people the same way I would like to be treated - with respect.</p>
                                <p>Being respectful also means being honest. When something is not well done, it needs to be communicated appropriately. This core pillar allows me to build meaningful relationships with my team and with time, build trust.</p>
                                <p><strong>Resilience</strong></p>
                                <p>Failures are quite common in game development. There are more chances of a game not working than of an outsized success. At the same time, being conservative in your bet is not going to help you win the market.</p>
                                <p>Chess has taught me to look at the board and activate all the pieces. Even then, failures are par for the course. This means it is more important to get back up and take more shots than just give up.</p>
                                <p>I have made peace with failures. I try now to instill the same in the teams I am working with. You never know what you find on the other side of the failure cliff and a high performing team will keep searching for that edge.</p>
                                <p><strong>JANUARY 2025 EDIT:</strong> The world is my Oyster. I have become increasingly convinced of this Steve Jobs' quote: <em>"Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you."</em></p>

                            <p class="article-preview">I was an athlete once. I loved sprinting. My choice event was the 100m dash. I built quite a collection of bronze and silver medals from those days. But I wasn't the fastest.</p>

                                <p><strong>I was an athlete once.</strong></p>
                                <p>I loved sprinting. My choice event was the 100m dash. I loved it. I was faster than many others and ranked among the top three in my school. I built quite a collection of bronze and silver medals from those days.</p>
                                <p>But, I wasn't the fastest. I didn't care much about that, till at least our sports teacher decided to take the next inter-school championship little more seriously. He enrolled us "athletes" into a running camp. And boy, was that hardcore.</p>
                                <p>Every day right after school, we assembled in our playground where the coach was already waiting with his equipment. I remember my 12-13 year old body giving up many times but we would still go on. He would try to break us every single day and every day he would succeed.</p>
                                <p>A week before the sports tournament, he took all of us aside and shared what events we will participate in. I was so sure that my name will be picked for the 100m dash, and I remember the lump I felt in my throat when I found that my name wasn't in that list. Heck, I didn't even make it to the 100m relay team. My name made it's mention only in the 1K. I didn't even know that there was an event like that.</p>
                                <p>I was gutted and I guessed this was obvious from my expression. He took me aside and told me to focus on my stamina and leg strengthening. He said he had high hopes for me in the long distance running. Looking back, he was kind. He left out the part where he didn't mention that I was hopeless in the 100m dash category.</p>
                                <p>Come race day, I found myself doing exceptionally well running long distances. Heck, I was well ahead of the competition. I won my first 1K and finished 2nd in the finals. I didn't know I had it in me and since then I have enjoyed long distance running.</p>
                                <p>The coach saw then what I didn't. I didn't have it in me to be the best at 100m dash. You need skill and talent, sure. You also need the mental fortitude which I lacked. I was ok being the 2nd best in my school - but I knew that was not good enough. He took my talent, and he maximized my chances of success by training me on stamina.</p>
                                <p>He broke me everyday, but he picked the right horse for the course. He pushed me everyday, and he chose a path for me that I have made my own. I have never participated in a 100m dash since then.</p>

                            <h2 class="article-title">Creativity vs. Shipping: Finding Balance in Game Development</h2>
                            <p class="article-preview">Finding the balance between creativity and delivering a game on time is hard, but necessary. It's probably the most important trait a producer needs in game development.</p>
                            <button class="read-more-btn" data-article="9">Read more</button>
                            <div class="article-full-content" id="article-9" style="display: none;">
                                <p><strong>HOW IS YOUR RHYTHM?</strong></p>
                                <p>Finding the balance between creativity and delivering a game on time is hard, but necessary. It's probably the most important trait a producer needs in game development.</p>
                                <p>Game post-mortems are littered with anecdotes of ideas that needed to be given more time to hit the quality benchmarks, or find product market fit. There are probably equal or more instances in game development where the team feels their development cycles are not nearly fast enough. We need to ship faster!</p>
                                <p>So how do you navigate and walk the tight rope? How do you find the balance?</p>
                                <p>Well, the answer is - "It depends."</p>
                                <p>The best leaders I have worked with typically approach this problem with the following mindset:</p>
                                <p>• There needs to be periods where the team needs to be creative. During this period, they have the license to go completely blue sky & off the rails. There will be no second thought given to killing old ideas for new ones or of work that's gone to waste. This is the period the right side of the brain will flex.</p>
                                <p>• There will also be periods where the team will focus on execution. This means gathering all the ideas, documenting and developing them. There will be lesser focus on new ideas, more focus on bringing current ideas to light. Heads down & build.</p>
                                <p><strong>The rhythm of moving game development along the phases of divergent and convergent thinking will eventually determine the success of your game.</strong></p>
                                <p>The entire game development lifecycle will be a tango dance between these 2 phases. You will have periods of blue sky and then a period of execution. This will define the rhythm of your game development and how well you manage the ground rules in these phases will determine the eventual success of your game.</p>
                                <p>Another useful way to think about creative decision is if it's a two way decision or an irreversible one. Take plenty of time for the irreversible decision points. For the ones you can walk back from, no point in mulling over it. Pick a solution and move as fast as you can. You can always come back to it later.</p>
                                <p>The success of the team depends on a number of creative decisions made through the game development lifecycle. The proof of the pudding is when the game finally ships and in players hands.</p>

                            <p class="article-preview">Several years ago in a meeting room that smelled like it had been occupied for way too long, we discussed our next bold beat. I lost it internally. New bold beat? We were struggling with regular releases.</p>

                                <p>Several years ago in a meeting room that smelled like it had been occupied for way too long, we discussed our next bold beat. Bold beat - a term from gaming for a major feature release.</p>
                                <p>I lost it internally.</p>
                                <p>New bold beat? We were struggling with regular releases. Every release had a hotfix. The team worked weekends just to cobble things together.</p>
                                <p>And now, a new bold beat?</p>
                                <p>My lips didn't move. My eyes didn't reveal my thoughts.</p>
                                <p>The discussion went on. Big features. Competitor analysis. Growth plans.</p>
                                <p><strong>The Wrong Optimization</strong></p>
                                <p>On one hand: you need stability. Clean releases. Predictable timelines. This is responsible leadership.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand: time is precious and every game is at war to demand player attention. Test fast, fail fast, ship fast. Six months to ship anything is a death sentence. All games die - the ones that take risks last longer.</p>
                                <p>My mind was wired for the first. The market demands the second. It didn't even register.</p>
                                <p>I sat there thinking everyone else was being reckless.</p>
                                <p>I was the reckless one. Reckless with time. Reckless with opportunity. Reckless by being risk averse. Craving stability that ensures death.</p>
