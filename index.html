                        <p class="post-description">The AI-native game space is still very early. Mobile gaming especially has been lagging behind, which is unusual because gaming typically leads innovation at the intersection of art, entertainment, tech, and consumer behavior. At Ripple AI, we're building games where if you remove the AI, the experience collapses. Games where players feel intelligence in every interaction. We're experimenting, iterating, learning—and just getting started.</p>
