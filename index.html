                <p class="description">Building AI-native games on Ripple AI—games where if you remove the AI, the experience collapses. We're at hour one of this transformation. Mobile gaming has been lagging in AI innovation, but that's about to change. Gaming has always bridged new technology and human experience, making tech emotional, expressive, and playable. At Ripple, we're designing loops that couldn't exist before now, where players feel intelligence in every interaction. We're experimenting, iterating, learning—and just getting started.</p>
