                            <h2 class="article-title">AI-Native Games: Still Hour One</h2>
                            <p class="article-preview">The AI-native game space is still very early. Mobile gaming especially has been lagging behind, which is unusual because gaming typically leads innovation at the intersection of art, entertainment, tech, and consumer behavior.</p>

                                <p>At Ripple AI, we're building games where if you remove the AI, the experience collapses. Games where players feel intelligence in every interaction.</p>
                                <p>What makes a game AI-native? A simple way to think about it: if you remove AI from an AI-native game, the game collapses. AI needs to be at the center—driving the core experience and moving the player from point A to point B.</p>
                                <p>The player must feel the AI. They don't need to know whether AI is generating the response, simulating logic, or mimicking a player—but they should feel the presence of intelligence in every interaction.</p>
                                <p>We're experimenting, iterating, learning—and just getting started. The questions we're asking: How do we make AI interactions feel natural and emotionally real? How do we design loops that collapse without AI at the center? How do we build experiences that couldn't exist before now?</p>
                                <p>We don't have all the answers yet. But the path forward is clear—games that live and breathe through intelligence. Not AI-assisted. Not AI-enhanced. AI-native.</p>

                                <p>The AI girlfriend is the core mechanic—every behavior, hint, and interaction driven by intelligence. This is our first mobile AI-native game where the entire experience is built around conversational AI.</p>
                                <p>Players must read between the lines, pick up on subtle cues, and make decisions that determine whether they escape or become another victim. The AI adapts to player choices, creating a unique experience every time.</p>
